        <a href="https://kuurth.com/" target="_blank">Kuurth</a>
        <ul>
        <li>Kuurth is an excellent example of the Contrast principle in web design. 
        <li>It uses a bold, dark background with striking, high-contrast text and images to grab the user's attention and create visual impact</li>
        <li> It also uses a lot of repetition which i mean all websites do somewhat, same letters fonts, has some animation when you hover each item </li>
        <li>you can see the images very clearly and the letters contrast through the animtion when you hover over the picture very simple colors</li>

        Crunchyroll</a>
        <li>Crunchyroll is a great example of the Repetition principle.</li> 
        <li>It maintains a consistent layout and design elements throughout the site, such as the use of the same fonts, colors, and navigation styles, providing a cohesive and familiar user experience.</li>
        <li>Each shows are align properly with each and every category</li>

            <dd>Gameheads represent a little bit of everything the.</dd>
            <br>
          <dt> Reason #2</dt>
          <dd>  Its content and elements are neatly organized and aligned both horizontally and vertically, creating a structured and visually pleasing layout for users to navigate.
            <br>    
        <dt>Reason #3</db>    
        <dd>colors are pleasant to the eyes in terms of contrast and the way things are align and the proximity of everything is not tooo close to each other</dd>
